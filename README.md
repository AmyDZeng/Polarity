# Polarity

A halloween themed infinite runner game built in Android and Java.

The objective of the game is to move on an infinitely scrolling surface where blocks are either black or white. While you move by swiping, you can change your colour on your next move by toggling the ghost icon to the bottom right. If you make a move and your ghost doesn't match that colour, you're done for! It may seem simple at first, but the scrolling progressively gets faster and faster.

Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polarity.summerproject.polarity&hl=en)
